# About the technical-functional specification for the facade

The suggested specification for such a facade currently comprises the following two documents:
- [FranceConnect Facade (FCF) Specifications](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/master/docs/Facade%20(FCF)%20Specifications.docx).
- [FranceConnect Facade (FCF) Specifications - Addendum](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/master/FranceConnect/Facade%20(FCF)%20Specifications%20-%20Addendum.docx).

This is a Work In Progress (WIP).
