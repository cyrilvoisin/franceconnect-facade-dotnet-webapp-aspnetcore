# About the "Getting Started" guide for FranceConnect Facade (FCF) code sample

**The guide is a Work In Progress (WIP).**

This document [Getting Started with FranceConnect Facade (FCF)](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/blob/main/Documentation/Getting%20Started%20with%20FranceConnect%20Facade%20(FCF).docx), as its title implicitly suggests, takes you and guides you through all the steps required to prepare a suitable local development environment, to deploy and set all the needed resources in the Azure Cloud for the production environment, as well as a portal application, etc. to ultimately configure and test the FranceConnect Fa√ßade (FCF) [code sample](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/main/Source).

With this knowledge, you should be able to further adapt the provided code if needed to accommodate your own specific situation and/or target a specific deployment in your production environment whatever it is.
