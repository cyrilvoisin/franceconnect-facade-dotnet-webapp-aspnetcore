# About the series of Bicep scripts for the FranceConnect Facade (FCF) code sample

**The [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) scripts will be available soon.Stay tuned! This is a Work In Progress (WIP).**

Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. In a Bicep file, you define the infrastructure you want to deploy to Azure, and then use that file throughout the development lifecycle to repeatedly deploy your infrastructure. Your resources are deployed in a consistent manner. 

As such, this series of scripts will help fulfilling the prerequites to deploy the code sample in your Azure subscription. Please refer to the ["Getting Started" guide](https://github.com/microsoft/franceconnect-facade-dotnet-webapp-aspnetcore/tree/master/Documentation).
